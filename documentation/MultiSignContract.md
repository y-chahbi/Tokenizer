## Core Components

### State Variables

| Variable | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `owners` | `address[]` | Array of wallet owner addresses |
| `required` | `uint256` | Number of confirmations required (immutable) |
| `transactionCount` | `uint256` | Total number of submitted transactions |
| `MAX_OWNERS` | `uint256` | Maximum allowed owners (50) |
| `MIN_REQUIRED` | `uint256` | Minimum required confirmations (1) |

### Transaction Structure

```solidity
struct Transaction {
    address to;                 // Recipient address
    uint256 amount;            // Amount of tokens to transfer  
    bool executed;             // Execution status
    uint256 confirmations;     // Number of confirmations received
    uint256 timestamp;         // When transaction was submitted
    address submitter;         // Who submitted the transaction
    string description;        // Optional description
}
```

### Key Mappings

- `mapping(address => bool) public isOwner`: Quick owner verification
- `mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => bool)) public isConfirmed`: Confirmation tracking
- `mapping(uint256 => Transaction) public transactions`: Transaction storage

## Usage Examples

### Deployment

```javascript
// Deploy with 3 owners requiring 2 confirmations
const owners = [
    "0x1234...",
    "0x5678...",
    "0x9abc..."
];
const requiredConfirmations = 2;

const contract = await Ycbmb42.deploy(owners, requiredConfirmations);
```

### Submit a Transaction

```javascript
// Submit transaction to transfer 1000 tokens
const recipient = "0xdef0...";
const amount = ethers.parseUnits("1000", 18);
const description = "Payment for services";

const txId = await contract.submitTransaction(recipient, amount, description);
```

### Check Transaction Status

```javascript
// Get transaction details
const transaction = await contract.getTransaction(txId);
console.log("Confirmations:", transaction.confirmations);
console.log("Executed:", transaction.executed);

// Check if specific owner confirmed
const isConfirmed = await contract.getConfirmationStatus(txId, ownerAddress);

// Check if ready to execute
const canExecute = await contract.canExecuteTransaction(txId);
```

### Confirm a Transaction

```javascript
// Confirm transaction as an owner
await contract.confirmTransaction(txId);

// Check who confirmed
const confirmedOwners = await contract.getConfirmedOwners(txId);
```

### Get Pending Transactions

```javascript
// Get all pending transactions
const pendingTxIds = await contract.getPendingTransactions();

// Process each pending transaction
for (const txId of pendingTxIds) {
    const tx = await contract.getTransaction(txId);
    console.log(`Transaction ${txId}: ${tx.amount} tokens to ${tx.to}`);
}
```
